This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To install and run the app run:

# npm i 
# npm start 

I used create react app to get up and running so that the code is transpiled to es6 and being abe to use modern javascript features.

I also used tachyons for css styling, and I added the option to delete comments.
